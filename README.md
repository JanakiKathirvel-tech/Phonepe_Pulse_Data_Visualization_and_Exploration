Step 1: create Database and necessary table with proper datatypes
step 2 : Insert the data from DataFrame to SQL

Dashboard Creation: Using Streamlit and Plotly to build an interactive dashboard.
Step : using Streamlit UI create different type analysis data taken from DB tables

Data Retrieval: Fetching data from the database to dynamically update the dashboard.
Step 1: Written 10 different queries to analyze
Step 2: Based on dropdown values show the chanrt differentyl
